     <p>
      Project 419 developed a set of tools and vocabulary to support the structured data on the web lifecycle.  These included:
      
     </p> 
     
     <ul>
       <li>
        Gleaner:  A tool to harvest and index a set of resources from a community.  The resources are defined by provider sitemaps pointing to web resources containing data graphs of structured data in a JSON-LD encoding.    

       </li>
       <li>
        Tangram:  A service that support Gleaner by providing a means to validate the structure of the data graphs Gleaner reads using a community developed and maintained validation or shape graph.  

      </li>
      <li>
        Fence: An online tools for developers using elements of Gleaner and invoking Tangram to provide an interface to allow developers to inspect and validate the data graphs during the adoption phase.

      </li>
     </ul>
      
      <p>
        These tools and  vocabulary provide a foundation for a data workflow.  
      </p>
     
      Tooling

The tooling has evolved from the P418 work to be fully deployable in a containerized system and use configuration files.  The goal of this work for Gleaner is to allow a larger audience of potential users to be reached.  The technical level is targeted at people who can install and run the Docker runtime on their computers and have a basic understanding of running command line and script based applications.

The Tangram and Fence packages run on-line and can be deployed to any container aware environment.  These systems were developed on the NSF XSEDE system and are currently running on Google Cloud though as containers could be deployed to Azure or AWS as well.
